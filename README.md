Creating an Amazon sales dashboard using Tableau involves collecting, preparing, and visualizing sales data to provide actionable insights.
This process includes gathering sales metrics such as total sales, units sold, revenue, and customer reviews from Amazon's sales reports, ensuring data consistency, and importing the data into Tableau. 
The dashboard design focuses on user-friendly navigation and clear visualizations using bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and heat maps.
Interactive elements and filters are incorporated to enable detailed data analysis.
The final dashboard is tested for accuracy and performance, providing valuable insights to inform data-driven decision-making for Amazon sales strategies.
